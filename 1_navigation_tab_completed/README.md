## What we want to do?

To start with, we want to implement navigation with tab bar, and keep the original screen.

We will make use of the following widgets
- `DefaultTabController` - The parent widget containing `TabBar` and `TabBarView`
- `TabBar` - The widget displaying the tabs, with appearance of tabs defined by an array of `Tab`
- `TabBarView` - The widget displaying the contents of each tabs, with content defined by an array of `Widget`
